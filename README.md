The goal of this project is to develop a music player using JavaScript that allows users to play and manage their music collection. The music player will have a user-friendly interface and provide essential features such as playing, pausing, skipping tracks, adjusting volume, and displaying track information.

Key Features:

1. User Interface: Design and implement an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the music player. This can include elements such as play/pause buttons, track progress bar, volume control, playlist display, and album artwork.

2. Audio Playback: Implement the functionality to load and play audio files in various formats, such as MP3, WAV, or OGG. Utilize the HTML5 Audio API or a JavaScript library like Howler.js or Tone.js to handle audio playback.

3. Play Controls: Allow users to control the playback of the music, including play, pause, next track, previous track, and seek to a specific position in the current track.

Overall, this project aims to create a robust and feature-rich music player using JavaScript that offers an enjoyable and seamless music listening experience for users.
